# CHRPT
This repository contains the code to develop and validate the risk prediction tool described in the manuscript 'Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Health Risk Prediction Tool for Post-Menopausal Women' with the hopes that others will apply these methods to new cohorts. The code used to create the web app using Shiny is also provided.
